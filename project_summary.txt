PROJECT TYPE:
End-to-End Machine Learning Classification Project

DATE CREATED:
October 21, 2024

================================================================================
1. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
================================================================================

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Develop a machine learning system to predict customer churn in the 
telecommunications industry, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

SPECIFIC GOALS:
- Analyze customer behavior patterns and identify churn indicators
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models
- Achieve high prediction accuracy (target: >80%)
- Create an interactive web application for real-time predictions
- Provide actionable insights for business decision-making
- Deploy the solution using Docker for scalability

================================================================================
2. BUSINESS PROBLEM
================================================================================

CONTEXT:
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry. 
Acquiring new customers costs 5-25 times more than retaining existing ones.
Early identification of at-risk customers allows companies to implement 
targeted retention strategies.

KEY QUESTIONS:
- Which customers are most likely to churn?
- What factors contribute most to customer churn?
- How can we predict churn before it happens?
- What retention strategies should be applied to high-risk customers?

IMPACT:
- Reduce customer acquisition costs
- Improve customer lifetime value
- Increase revenue through better retention
- Optimize marketing and retention budgets
