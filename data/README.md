## üîÑ Data Loading Instructions

### Option 1: Copy File Here

1. Copy your file from:
   ```
   C:\Users\lssan\Downloads\P585 Churn.xlsx
   ```

2. Paste it into this `data/` folder

3. Rename to `telecom_churn.xlsx` (or keep original name and update scripts)

### Option 2: Update Path in Scripts

If you prefer to keep the file in its original location, update the `data_path` variable in:

- `scripts/data_preprocessing.py`
- `scripts/eda_visualization.py`
- `notebooks/telecom_churn_eda.ipynb`

Example:
```python
data_path = r"C:\Users\lssan\Downloads\P585 Churn.xlsx"
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After placing your dataset, verify it loads correctly:

```python
import pandas as pd

# For CSV
df = pd.read_csv('data/telecom_churn.csv')

# For Excel
df = pd.read_excel('data/telecom_churn.xlsx')

print(f"Dataset loaded: {df.shape[0]} rows, {df.shape[1]} columns")
print(f"Columns: {list(df.columns)}")
```

## üìù Notes

- The `data/` folder is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing large datasets
- Make sure your dataset has a clear target column (e.g., 'Churn')
- Check for any special characters or encoding issues in column names
- Ensure there are no completely empty rows or columns

## üö® Important

**Do not commit sensitive customer data to version control!**

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude data files, but always verify before pushing to a repository.
